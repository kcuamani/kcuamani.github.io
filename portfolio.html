        <p>Description: In this game, you have to defeat the enemy ghoul as the breakdancer and cat in turn-based combat. The user is scored after attacking,
        with damage dealt being displayed onscreen. Randomness occurs whenever you attack or take damage. The game gets difficult when the ghoul's HP is
        less than 125, as it begins to heal after the player's turn is over, or it lowers the damage it takes from the player characters. The game ends
        when time is over, the player defeats the enemy, or the player is defeated.</p>
        <p>Reflection: I chose to create a turn-based RPG since it would be easy to program and it doesn't require many cosmetic changes. Two successful 
        points would be the damage detection and commands. Two obstacles would be getting the code to properly work and characters attacking when it's not
        their turn. If I had more time, I would work in better attack animations and more attack types.</p>

        <p> This script is vital to the program as it indicates how much damage the enemy has taken and also controls when the game ends.</p>
